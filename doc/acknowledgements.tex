\section{Acknowledgements}

Before diving into the book, I want to give out a special gratitude for:
	Joren Heit, for the invitation to take part in building the processor and for providing enough materials, tools, and components (see \ref{sec:inventory});
	And the school administration for providing a separate room in the building for storage and the development of the processor, and for the whiteboard used to make circuits, diagrams, and analyzing wrong behavior.
