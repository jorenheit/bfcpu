\section{Inventory} \label{sec:inventory}
For the creation of the processor we used a vast inventory of tools and elements, like resistors, LEDs, and capacitors. However, other components are, mostly, digital chips created by different manufacturers and have also been utilized. In this section, we provide the reader with an approximate list of all tools and components utilized or used during the process.

\subsection{Electronic components}
\begin{itemize}
	\item LEDs with different colors (white, yellow, red, blue, and green);
	\item Capacitors of a wide range (from 0.1 (nano Farad) up to 4000 (micro Farad));
	\item Resistors of a wide range (from 10 Ohm up to 1M Ohm);
	\item Seven-segment displays;
	\item Ribbon cables;
	\item Diodes;
